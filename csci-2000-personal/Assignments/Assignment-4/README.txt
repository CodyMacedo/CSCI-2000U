2.(b) To make th CSV file, I copied the first column to the 
	Source_data_for_CFR_vaccine_map_abridged.csv file. Next I took the 
	column of data and copied it to a temp text file. I created a python 
	script that took the data from the temp text file and appended each line
	of that file to the .csv file with a comma between each data set. I then
	repeated the process of transfering the remaining columns to the temp 
	file and running the script again until the file was complete.
    I got rid of all the odd cases that didn't fit the expected format.
